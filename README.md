# cuturl

## 📌 Project Description

`cuturl` is a lightweight URL shortening service project.
It was created as a personal development project to understand how URL redirection,
identifier generation, and basic backend logic work in a simple web service.

The project focuses on the **core mechanics of a URL shortener** rather than full-scale service features.
